# Voord - Hackaway v5

**Voord** is an **Ord**ered **Vo**ting app created by Matt Tantony at the Royal Hackaway, 5-6 February 2022.

It's a .NET 6 console app that lets people create and vote on multiple-choice polls. You cast your vote by putting all the candidates in preferential order (from worst to best). The app uses a log function to convert the jurors' preferences into points and determine the poll winner. This app was inspired by the voting method used by the international juries in the Eurovision Song Contest.

A Voord is also this faintly sinister **Doctor Who** monster from the 1960s:
